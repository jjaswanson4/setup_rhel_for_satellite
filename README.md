# setup_rhel_for_satellite

Ansible collection for validating a RHEL host to run satellite.

This collection is also available on [ansible galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/jjaswanson4/setup_rhel_for_satellite).

## Overview
This collection will validate a RHEL7 host against the [system requirements](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.7/html/installing_satellite_server_from_a_connected_network/preparing-environment-for-satellite-installation#system-requirements_satellite) and [storage requirements](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.7/html/installing_satellite_server_from_a_connected_network/preparing-environment-for-satellite-installation#satellite-storage-requirements_satellite) for running satellite.

If a system passes validation, LVM will be configured according to the following procedure:
- LVs will be created
- The LVs will get an XFS filesystem
- The LVs will be added to /etc/fstab

* Note: for now, the LVs will be on the same volume group as /var. There is an [issue](https://github.com/jjaswanson4/setup_rhel_for_satellite/issues/1) open on github about this.

## Usage
The best way to consume this collection is to set up a requirements.yml:
```
---
collections:
  - jjaswanson4.setup_rhel_for_satellite
```
The collection can also be installed from the command line ad-hoc:
```
ansible-galaxy collection install jjaswanson4.setup_rhel_for_satellite
```

## Examples
- There are example playbooks located in playbooks directory
- Vars examples can be found in playbooks/vars

## Vars
```

## Inventory Structure
For this collection, it doesn't matter if you're building a satellite server or a capsule server, the LVs will be collected and created. It's a good idea to break out satellite servers vs. capsule servers and specify their var files so each will be built according to their own specifications:
```
[satellite]
satellite67.josh.lab.msp.redhat.com vars_file=/home/jswanson/ansible/satellite6.7-collections/satellite67.josh.lab.msp.redhat.com.vars.yml ansible_user=root

[capsule]
capsule67-01.josh.lab.msp.redhat.com vars_file=/home/jswanson/ansible/satellite6.7-collections/capsule67-01.josh.lab.msp.redhat.com.vars.yml ansible_user=root
capsule67-02.josh.lab.msp.redhat.com vars_file=/home/jswanson/ansible/satellite6.7-collections/capsule67-02.josh.lab.msp.redhat.com.vars.yml ansible_user=root
```
